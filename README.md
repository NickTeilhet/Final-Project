# Final-Project

What I am going to do is create a search box where you can search for an artist and see the venues they are playing at. You will then be able to select a venue and see all of the details of that show (location, time, ticket price, etc.)

I will likely get data from another website. I will also use a database for the information on each of the venues as well as which venues the artist will be playing at.
